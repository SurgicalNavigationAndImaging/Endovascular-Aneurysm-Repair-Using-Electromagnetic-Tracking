# Endovascular-Aneurysm-Repair-Using-Electromagnetic-Tracking

This repository has been created by Celia de la Fuente Montero, Sandra Eizaguerri Gallardo, Ana Gonz√°lez Aranda, Duarte Moura and Paula Ochotorena Santacilia from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. It presents an approach to develop a phantom-based simulation for endovascular aneurysm procedures using electromagnetic tracking, focusing on enhancing surgical accuracy and safety while minimizing radiation exposure to patients.

This project involves creating a simulated environment for endovascular aneurysm procedures, whose setup involves using the 3D-printed model of the aneurysm and aortic and iliac arteries, electromagnetic tracking and connection with 3D Slicer.
